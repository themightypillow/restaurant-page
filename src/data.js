const homeWiki = "French fries are prepared by first cutting the potato (peeled\
                  or unpeeled) into even strips, which are then wiped off or\
                  soaked in cold water to remove the surface starch, and\
                  thoroughly dried. They may then be fried in one or two\
                  stages. Chefs generally agree that the two-bath technique\
                  produces better results. Potatoes fresh out of the ground\
                  can have too high a water content—resulting in soggy fries—so\
                  preference is for those that have been stored for a\
                  while. French fries are fried in a two step process: the\
                  first time is to cook the starch throughout the entire cut\
                  at a low heat, and the second time is to create the golden\
                  crispy exterior of the fry at a higher temperature."
